# Nerine OS Website Development Guide

This document describes how to build, structure, and deploy the official Nerine OS website.  
It covers the file layout, page architecture, development workflow, hosting method, and update procedures.

The Nerine OS website is a static HTML/CSS/JS site hosted on GitHub Pages.  
It is designed to be simple to maintain, fast to load, and compatible with any browser or device.

## 1. Website Directory Structure

The recommended file layout for the website is:

```
nerinelinux.github.io/
│
├── index.html
├── download.html
├── download-kde.html
├── download-xfce.html
├── download-gnome.html
├── desktops.html
├── features.html
├── docs.html
├── about.html
├── community.html
├── gallery.html
├── faq.html
├── roadmap.html
├── developer.html
├── changelog.html
│
├── styles.css
├── main.js
│
└── assets/
    ├── images/
    │   ├── wallpapers/
    │   └── screenshots/
    ├── icons/
    └── logos/
```

All pages use the same header, footer, styling, and script files for consistency.

## 4. Creating the Website

Follow these steps to create a clean, functional Nerine OS website.

### Step 1: Write the stylesheet  
Create a single `styles.css` file that defines:

- Color palette  
- Layout structure  
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)  
- Components such as buttons, cards, grids  
- Navigation and footer styling  

Use consistent classes across all HTML pages.

### Step 2: Build the navigation bar  
Use the same `<nav>` element on every page to maintain uniformity.

```
<nav>
    <div><a href="index.html"><b>Nerine OS</b></a></div>
    <div>
        <a href="download.html">Download</a>
        <a href="desktops.html">Desktops</a>
        <a href="features.html">Features</a>
        <a href="docs.html">Docs</a>
        <a href="community.html">Community</a>
        <a href="about.html">About</a>
    </div>
</nav>
```

### Step 3: Build the footer  
Place this at the bottom of every page:

```
<footer>
    © 2025 Nerine Linux
</footer>
```

### Step 4: Build the landing page  
The home page should contain:

- A header/hero section  
- A short introduction  
- Links to features and downloads  
- A call to action  

### Step 5: Add download pages  
Each DE has its own page.  
When the ISOs are published via GitHub Releases, link to them using:

```
https://github.com/YOUR-USER/nerine-os/releases/download/v1.0/nerine-kde.iso
```

Use a button:

```
<a href="URL_HERE" class="btn-primary">Download ISO</a>
```

### Step 6: Add screenshots  
Place images in:

```
assets/images/screenshots/
```

Use `<img>` tags in `gallery.html` and the download pages.

### Step 7: Add documentation  
Update the `docs.html` page with installation instructions, gaming mode descriptions, and troubleshooting.

## 5. Hosting the Website on GitHub Pages

### Step 1: Upload Files  
Push the entire website folder to the GitHub repository:

```
nerinelinux.github.io
```

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages  
Navigate to:

Settings → Pages →  
Select:  
- Branch: main  
- Folder: / (root)

Save.

GitHub will generate the site at:

```
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io
```

### Step 3: Connect your custom domain  
If you own `nerinelinux.com`, configure DNS:

A records:
```
185.199.108.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.110.153
185.199.111.153
```

CNAME:
```
www → YOUR-USERNAME.github.io
```

Then in GitHub Pages, set:

```
nerinelinux.com
```

Enable HTTPS.

## 6. Updating the Website

To update a page:

1. Edit the HTML, CSS, or JS  
2. Commit changes  
3. Push to GitHub  

GitHub Pages redeploys automatically.

For local testing, open any file in a browser:

```
index.html
```

## 7. Optional Enhancements

- Responsive mobile layout  
- Light/dark theme switch  
- Download mirrors page  
- ISO checksums  
- Documentation sub-site  
- Release version pages  
- Package repository index page
